# Multicampus_semi_project
This is my first project as a Data Analyst and the project was done with Multicampus(based in Seoul, Gangnam) between Nov 14th, 2023 ~ Nov 20th, 2023 (4.5 days) to review what i learned in the first month.

This project is to analize and predict three movies to be released in South Korea in Nov & Dec 2023.

In order to execute the analisys and prediction, I've used a dataset from KOBIS and crawled Korean search engine Naver.
